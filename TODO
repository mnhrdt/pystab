TODO

- ease access to the inner prng
- implement all Weron's fixes to the simulation formulae
- fix normalization factor sqrt(2) convention (unclear how!)
- implement other fitting methods
- at least, make sure that the given parameters are compatible with the data
- maybe build and use a much higher-resolution mcculloch table
- provide separate C packaging (without python)
- modernize setup.py according to current zeitgeist



DESIGN REQUIREMENTS

- no dependencies allowed from the C side
- hard python dependencies: ctypes (for the C/python interface)
- soft python dependencies: numpy (not required for the scalar-only interface)
- no further depencencies allowed in the python part
- should work if pip-installed locally on linux, openbsd, macos
- can be installed directly under common environemnts (collab, vscode, ...)
